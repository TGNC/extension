Open issues:

1. What about using tor browser - need to support firefox extension? and what about anonymously?

2. What happens if the search matches asset of two accounts?
    Possible solutions:
        1. If the search was from our system - we know on which account the analyst is working on.
        2. If we don't know which account - use the extension to show a popup to the analyst to select the specific Account.
